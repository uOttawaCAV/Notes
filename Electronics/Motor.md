### Nominal
- Optimal value for operations

### Current
- ##### Nominal Current (max. continuous current)
	- amount of current run through the motor with the winding overheating 
	- can temporarily go well beyond, but only for short bursts
	- 16.8 A

- ##### Max. no load current
	- Maximum current motor draws when there is no mechanical load applied
	- current required to overcome internal losses and friction
	- 3 A

- ##### Maximum Current
	- Can only handle this amount of current for a period of time
	- 120 A (max. 5 sec. )
