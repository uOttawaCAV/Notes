### What are Motor Encoders?
- measures the position and speed of  a motor's shaft
- provide feedback to the motor control system

### Types
- ##### Absolute Motor Encoders
	- ###### Single-Turn 
		- provide a unique code for each position of the motor shaft within a revolution
		- suitable for applications where motor shaft has limited rotation
	- ###### Multi-turn
		- provide a unique code for each position of the shaft within multiple revolutions
		- ideal for situation where motor shaft rotates multiple time
	- Provides control system with an absolute position value rather than a relative position value 
	- for control systems that require high levels of accuracy and precision

- ##### Incremental Motor Encoders 
	- provide signal that indicates the direction and number of steps a motor has taken
	- simple and cost-effective
	- provide position value
		- not ==absolute position==
		- essentially provides indications that the position has changed


### Mounting Options
- ##### Shafted Motor Encoders
	- coupling method (?) to connect the motor encoder shaft to the motor shaft
	- coupling provides mechanical and electrical isolation from the motor shaft
	- additional cost of coupling and longer shaft length
- ##### Hub/Hollow shaft Motor Encoders
	- directly mount to the motor shaft via spring-loaded tether
	- easy to install
	- no shaft alignment
	- proper care to ensure electrical isolation
- ##### Bearing-less Motor Encoders
	- ring mount
	- comprises a magnetic sensor assembly in the form of a ring
	- heavy-duty applications
